        Hi, My name is Peter Kim, currently working as a freelance web / app
        developer in Melbourne.
        <br />
        I've started my journey as a developer in 2017 when I was working as a
        factory floor manager in Brisbane (I know it sounds odd). Back then, the
        company had no system to manage the inventory, so I started making one
        myself using excel. Little later as I moved in to the office as a
        manager, I then started making a tiny CRM using PHP and JS after
        realising the limitations excel had.
        <br />
        Ever since, I've worked on various paid / hobby projects whilist trying
        and using multiple technologies / languages / frameworks, which
        eventually lead me to shift my career as a full-time freelance
        developer.
